Construction of a family of Fibonacci-type trees that arise in the study of sparse amoeba graphs. Concretely, it is the first example of an infinite family of global amoebas with arbitrary maximum degree ([2, Section 3]).

Recently, it was found that these trees are actually *local* amoebas, which is stronger (see [1]). That project was in part inspired by the computations present in this repository.
